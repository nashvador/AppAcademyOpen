# Write a method, coprime?(num_1, num_2), that accepts two numbers as args.
# The method should return true if the only common divisor between the two numbers is 1.
# The method should return false otherwise. For example coprime?(25, 12) is true because
# 1 is the only number that divides both 25 and 12.

puts "hi"
def coprime(number1, number2)
   (2..number2).each do |val|
        if number1%val == 0 && number2%val == 0
            return false
        end
     
end



p coprime?(25, 12)    # => true
p coprime?(7, 11)     # => true
p coprime?(30, 9)     # => false
p coprime?(6, 24)     # => false
