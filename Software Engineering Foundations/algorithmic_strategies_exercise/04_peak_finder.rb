# Write a method, peak_finder(arr), that accepts an array of numbers as an arg.
# The method should return an array containing all of "peaks" of the array.
# An element is considered a "peak" if it is greater than both it's left and right neighbor.
# The first or last element of the array is considered a "peak" if it is greater than it's one neighbor.

# So initiially i looped through the array assigning each value of the array to the i, then I realized that I did not want to loop through the array itself but from 0 to the array length

    if i == 0
        if arr[i] > arr[i+1]
